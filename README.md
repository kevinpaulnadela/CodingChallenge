# JSON 2 CSV JS App

A Javascript based app to parse JSON data and outputs into CSV file via clicking Download button.

The generated CSV file has been validated and tested through https://csvlint.io. 

## Columns Populated

These are the columns that are required to display on the CSV:

| Columns |
| :---: | 
| order_id |
| order_datetime |
| total_order_value |
| average_unit_price |
| distinct_unit_count |
| total_units_count |
| customer_state |

### Computations

Computations have been based from my understanding in the description of fields.

total_order_value

```
total_order_value                                                                ==============================================================                                                                                                               
```
